# Project State

## Project Reference

See: [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) (project scope and decisions; updated 2026-09-15).

**Core value:** Product and engineering teams can collaboratively turn ideas into clear product and technical plans on a shared, editable canvas that supports their daily work well enough to replace Miro.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Okta and Board Access. Phase 2 is complete; next-phase discussion, research and planning are next.

## Current Position

Phase: 3 — Okta and Board Access
Current Plan: Not started
Total Plans in Phase: TBD
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-15 — Phase 2 complete, transitioned to Phase 3

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 15% (2/13 phases complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) (full decisions and constraints) and [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) (approved requirements and validation obligations).

- All 42 v1 requirements are user-approved. The 13-phase roadmap is approved; all five Phase 1 plans are accepted and complete.
- Deliver small sequential MVP capability phases; independent tasks may run in parallel within an approved phase. Prioritize daily mind maps immediately after core canvas editing.
- Extend DJAI Open Canvas with applicable attribution; deploy on operator-managed infrastructure using Okta and per-board owner/editor/viewer permissions.
- Collaboration has no product-enforced concurrent-user cap; validate 20 concurrent authenticated editors. Comments attach to specific entities, and image export includes selected shapes only when requested.
- v1 includes ordinary-object roadmaps/templates and a task/date-driven Gantt widget. MCP and Plane are deferred; ClickUp imports are excluded.
- [Phase 1]: Retain BlockSuite 0.22.4 and browser storage identifiers; verify local persistence through native UI and IndexedDB reload.
- [Phase 1]: Use maintained Vite 7.3 with esbuild native decorators and a scoped BlockSuite CSS optimizer hook.
- [Phase 1]: Keep optional sharing empty and attribution linked to pinned public source.
- [Phase 1]: Use the accessible left rail with native BlockSuite tools and contextual style controls.
- [Phase 1]: Use guarded BlockSuite 0.22.4 native raster seams for explicit PNG source scale; rerun fidelity tests on upgrade.
- [Phase 1]: Accept validated PNG/JPEG with bounded decode, native model-space insertion and a final native mutation guard; retain explicit native OS evidence limits alongside user acceptance.
- [Phase 1]: Preserve native selected IDs and layer order; clip frame output and preflight each intermediate DOM raster before allocation.
- [Phase 2]: Phase 2 preserves native fontSize/fontWeight/color and runs collapse plus layout synchronously inside one captured transaction.
- [Phase 2]: Capture native duplicate source identities at invocation and validate native hierarchy before duplicate, paste and board snapshot conversion.
- [Phase 2]: Phase 2 commands validate native topology iteratively, preserve omitted defaults on rollback, and remove failed additions after native add observers flush.
- [Phase 2]: Preserve native typography and full child records through both contextual and upstream layout controls; scope composition to the native topic editor.

### Pending Todos

- Discuss and research Phase 3 identity and board-access defaults before planning. Retain surfaced seeds and the drawing-palette follow-up for separate scheduling. The historical RED-test process deviation remains in WINDOWS.md.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Upstream capabilities and proposed technology combinations have source-level research only; runtime, real Okta, deployment, recovery, and collaboration remain unverified.
- Automated Phase 1 evidence covers dependencies, native APIs, export bounds and fidelity. Image import was approved by the user on 2026-09-12; copy/paste is also user-approved; approved metadata remediation is complete.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Agent creation | Authenticated, board-authorized MCP creation of editable diagrams and mind maps | Deferred | 2026-09-11 requirements | v2 allocation open |
| Integration | Plane task linkage and task data for planning views | Deferred | 2026-09-11 requirements | v2 allocation open |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-09-15
Stopped at: Phase 2 complete, ready to plan Phase 3
Resume file: None
Next action: $gsd-discuss-phase 3 — establish Okta/OIDC and board-access decisions, then research and plan the approved Phase 3 capability. Phase-wide approval and native-environment reporting limits are recorded in 02-UAT.md.

## Phase 1 verification outcome

Complete: five plans, five requirements, and four user-approved UAT checks. Current regression: 51 unit tests and 256 browser cases passed, with typecheck and production build passing. Canonical verification is refreshed; all 17 registered security threats are closed. Individual native OS steps were not separately reported, and that limit remains documented. Phase 2 plan 02-01 now supplies the native mind-map tracer and compatibility evidence.

## Phase 2 verification outcome

Complete: nine plans, four requirements (MIND-01 through MIND-04), five accepted UAT checklist items and six resolved reported gaps. User statement: "Phase 2 tested and approved." Current revision refresh passed 29 production Chromium cases, all 67 unit tests, TypeScript checks and the production build. Earlier broad and cross-browser runs retain their original revision scope. Individual native browser/OS/input details were not separately supplied; the approval is recorded at phase level. No Phase 2 acceptance blocker remains.

Phase 2 was tested and approved on 2026-09-15. Canonical verification is passed with a refreshed coverage fingerprint; quick corrections retain their separate validation provenance.

### Quick follow-up awaiting decision

260915-drawing-palettes: consolidated five-category menu and native shape/line palettes implemented. Additional stars, arrow shapes, and polygons await the user's choice of full shape support versus grouped outlines. See [summary](quick/260915-drawing-palettes/SUMMARY.md). This separate follow-up does not block the approved Phase 2 capability.
